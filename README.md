# Recipe Web Design

#### This is the base of other application will implement it, i use this:
- HTML
- CSS
- JAVASCRIPT
- BOOTSTRAP 5.3.1,

#### nothing more because it is the base design. And if you ask me about the problem i face in every second i code, it is just the positioning the element in html using css and bootstrap. And i hope, i can standarized the other pages based on what pijar camp wants it.

#### What thing should i need?
#### And about the installation, there is nothing fancy about the tools. Just at least 3 tools you need, first is computer, second is network, and the last one is github account. Oh yeah, last but not least, just clone it or manually download it.

#### How to run this?
#### Well, just run the index.html file.
